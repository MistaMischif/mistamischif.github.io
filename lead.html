  <p>
    Effective leadership is about building systems and cultures that endure—empowering others, fostering trust, and communicating a shared vision. My guiding principle is simple: create processes and environments where people thrive, not by command, but through mentorship and example.
  </p>
										  									  <p> As an art director, project manager and team lead, mentoring and coaching teams has become a passion of mine that I continue to refine with each product. Working across so many mediums has allowed an understanding of concepts like lighting, materials, form, layout and composition that is enhanced by my ability to jump from the real world to digital, 2D to 3D and even into abstract and conceptual thinking to solve problems and sometimes create new ones (to solve better). As we approach a new era of digital creation with the advance of AI and Quantum computing, the artists that work endlessly in the trenches to refine their approach will be the new engineers.</p>

									<h3><a href="#">Adaptability and Best Practices&nbsp;</a></h3>
								</header>
										<p> Having built studios and pipelines from the ground up, I champion adaptability—embracing new technologies and methods, and always seeking to refine best practices for ever-changing project needs. Before Midway Games crashed, before Zynga bought Spooky Cool, before AI became a 4 letter art word--a few of us saw it coming and adjusted. The ability to hold firm during a potential studio closure, that turned into a buyout, takes mettle, as does leaving a thriving company to join a startup. Those are the rigors and tests that Leaders must approach with curiousity, fear, respect, and a winning, experienced persona.</p>

									<h3><a href="#">Clear Vision, Clear Process</a></h3>
							</header>
<p>Great leadership starts with providing a clear, communicable vision, and ensuring processes are documented and accessible—not locked away in one person’s mind.&nbsp; When everyone understands the “why” and the “how,” creativity and collaboration flourish. So often, 'brain-trust' seems built into the culture of studios, where a single person holds critical information and it's not documented. With todays technology, leaders should easily cut through this issue with ease, and open up the lines of communication to create a cohesive vision for products.</p>

									<h3><a href="#">Empowerment Through Trust&nbsp;</a></h3>
							</header>
						      <p>By prioritizing mentoring and supporting team members so they can grow and innovate. By trusting people with responsibility, I foster ownership and accountability in every project, and absolutely do not micromanage any individual, team, nor client. I believe if you hire somebody, internal or external, it is your responsibility to hire people you trust. Of course one must mentor, allowing growth and eventually succeeding in their own goals </p>

									<h3><a href="#">Experience Driven</a></h3>
								</header>
										<p> Theory is best left for the concepting phase, and it's an experienced art director or professional that understands when, and where that phase is. When the time comes to 'GO', there is nothing more valuable than practical experience. This ranges from the engines and tools used, to the repositories, understanding and ability to conversate on the highest level, technically and otherwise to ensure the needs of the clients are met.</p>

									<h3><a href="#">Lead by Example</a></h3>
								</header>
<p>I lead with integrity, humility, and a focus on continuous improvement. When leaders show respect for others, acknowledge mistakes, and seek feedback, it creates an environment of psychological safety—essential for creative teams to thrive. And yes I've taken some missteps, and I'm proud of every single one. There are no accidents, only course corrections.</p>

										<p>
									    Truly a KING of all trades in the visual arts, as well as a visitor to the culinary and musical arts, my life's experiences stretch across all means of creating.&nbsp; </p>

										<p>Combining technical prowess and art is now a commodity in development, and I believe the ability to create across mediums in Real-Life will dictate tomorrows art directors.&nbsp; As such, it's exciting because while I am truly a professional in the digital realm, I feel my work in the real world is just beginning...again.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

This breadth allows me to mentor across disciplines and develop creative solutions that bridge the gap between concept and execution—including at the intersection of art and technology.</p>
