  <h1>Leadership Rooted in Vision and Results</h1>
  <p>
    Effective leadership is about building systems and cultures that endure—empowering others, fostering trust, and communicating a shared vision. My guiding principle is simple: create processes and environments where people thrive, not by command, but through mentorship and example.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>My Approach</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Transparency, Trust, and Shared Purpose:</strong> Great leaders are facilitators and catalysts, not just decision-makers.</li>
    <li><strong>Adaptability &amp; Continuous Improvement:</strong> Navigating industry shifts—studio acquisitions, new technologies, and evolving best practices—means remaining flexible and solution-oriented.</li>
    <li><strong>Leading by Example:</strong> Integrity, humility, and openness to feedback create teams that feel safe to innovate and grow.</li>
    <li><strong>Clear Vision, Documented Processes:</strong> Open communication and shared understanding drive creativity and efficiency, breaking down silos and unlocking collective potential.</li>
    <li><strong>Empowerment:</strong> I mentor and trust my teams, shaping an environment where growth is encouraged and accountability is shared.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Experience-Driven Art Direction</h2>
  <p>
    Leadership extends beyond theory; practical experience delivers the greatest value. As an art director and project manager, I draw from a diverse background spanning visual, culinary, and musical arts. This breadth allows me to mentor across disciplines and develop creative solutions that bridge the gap between concept and execution—including at the intersection of art and technology.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Quantifiable Impact and Process Optimization</h2>
  <p>
    I guide teams by shaping modular, adaptable workflows that balance resources and priorities. Each client and project receives a tailored approach, leveraging my experience in project management and resource allocation to maximize ROI and deliver excellence.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Core Leadership Principles</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Competition:</strong> Success is built on collaboration and team spirit that no office layout can replicate.</li>
    <li><strong>Resilience:</strong> Industry experience has prepared me to anticipate change and lead through transitions.</li>
    <li><strong>Creativity:</strong> Award-winning game design and a playful spirit fuel everything I do.</li>
    <li><strong>Storytelling:</strong> My approach connects the discipline of art with narrative, shaping both visual and experiential outcomes.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Philosophy</h2>
  <p>
    Leadership is not a title—it’s a responsibility earned by actions and perspective. I believe true leaders instill confidence, inspire growth, and anchor their teams with purpose and integrity.
  </p>
</section>
<!--
										<h2><a href="#">Leadership Earned&nbsp;</a></h2>
<p> Experience, Knowledge, Compassion. Leadership is one of my biggest areas of study, and concern when it comes to working with others. </p>
									  <p>My philosophy is pretty basic:&nbsp;Build processes and cultures that outlive any single person. It’s both a privilege and a responsibility to guide others not by rigid control, but by nurturing the conditions where excellence becomes possible.&nbsp;</p>
									  <p>Drawing on two decades of hands-on experience leading creative teams and mentoring artists, my philosophy on leadership centers around building a culture where transparency, trust, and shared purpose drive results. I believe the best leaders are not just decision-makers—they are facilitators and catalysts who empower others, set clear expectations, and remove barriers so that everyone can perform at their highest potential&nbsp;</p>
									  <p>Adaptability &amp; Best Practices: Having built studios and pipelines from the ground up, I champion adaptability—embracing new technologies and methods, and always seeking to refine best practices for ever-changing project needs. Before Midway Games crashed, before Zynga bought Spooky Cool, before AI became an 4 letter art word--a few of us saw it coming and adjusted. The ability to hold firm during a potential studio closure, that turned into a buyout, takes mettle, as does leaving a thriving company to join a startup. Those are the rigors and tests that Leaders must approach with curiousity, fear, respect, and a winning, experienced attitude&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
									  <p>Lead by Example: I lead with integrity, humility, and a focus on continuous improvement. When leaders show respect for others, acknowledge mistakes, and seek feedback, it creates an environment of psychological safety—essential for creative teams to thrive. And yes I've taken some missteps, and I'm proud of every single one. There are no accidents, only course corrections&nbsp;</p>
									  <p>Clear Vision, Clear Process: Great leadership starts with providing a clear, communicable vision, and ensuring processes are documented and accessible—not locked away in one person’s mind. When everyone understands the “why” and the “how,” creativity and collaboration flourish. So often, 'brain-trust' seems built into the culture of studios, where a single person holds critical information and it's not documented. With todays technology, leaders should easily cut through this issue with ease, and open up the lines of communication to create a cohesive vision for products&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
										<p>Empowerment Through Trust: I prioritize mentoring and supporting team members so they can grow and innovate. By trusting people with responsibility, I foster ownership and accountability in every project, and absolutely do not micromanage any individual, team, nor client. I believe if you hire somebody, internal or external, it is your responsibility to hire people you trust. Of course one must mentor, allowing growth and eventually succeeding in their own goalls&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
                                    </header>
									<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/pic06.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<h2><a href="#">Experience Driven&nbsp;&nbsp;</a></h2>
									<p>
								    Theory is best left for the concepting phase, and it's an experienced art director or professional that understands when, and where that phase is. When the time comes to 'GO', there is nothing more valuable than practical experience. This ranges from the engines and tools used, to the repositories, understanding and ability to conversate on the highest level, technically and otherwise to ensure the needs of the clients are met. </p>

										<h2><a href="#">Art Direction&nbsp;&nbsp;</a></h2>
										</header>
										<p>
									    Truly a KING of all trades in the visual arts, as well as a visitor to the culinary and musical arts, my life's experiences stretch across all means of creating.&nbsp; </p>
									  <p> As an art director, project manager and team lead, mentoring and coaching teams has become a passion of mine that I continue to refine with each product. Working across so many mediums has allowed an understanding of concepts like lighting, materials, form, layout and composition that is enhanced by my ability to jump from the real world to digital, 2D to 3D and even into abstract and conceptual thinking to solve problems and sometimes create new ones (to solve better). As we approach a new era of digital creation with the advance of AI and Quantum computing, the artists that work endlessly in the trenches to refine their approach will be the new engineers.</p>
										<p>Combining technical prowess and art is now a commodity in development, and I believe the ability to create across mediums in Real-Life will dictate tomorrows art directors.&nbsp; As such, it's exciting because while I am truly a professional in the digital realm, I feel my work in the real world is just beginning...again.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

											<h3>Quantifiable Returns</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
									    Gauging ability, productivity and ROI's are critical in leadership roles. The following ideas are the pillars I base my work off from. Each represents their own special caveats that create a whole new type of leader for todays environment, and all share common goals that are associated with B2B/B2C practices to ensure results are delivered to the highest quality standards.&nbsp; </p>

										<h3><a href="#">Art Outsource/Project Management</a></h3>
                                    </header>
								  <p> As a certified Project Manager and vetted Art Outsource Manager, my leadership relies on facets from different aspects of my experiences. My professional art career only paints 1/4 of the picture, as my full breadth ranges daily between  running a family of 5 and multiple houselholds/rental properties    in different states, to coaching winning soccer teams, to continued successes within the Indie development scene.</p>
								  <p>This all applies to the methods I use to manage based on resources. As the table gets full, what gets shifted, what takes priority, and what gets cut?&nbsp;</p>
									<p>These ideas happen everyday in leadership roles and deserve attention that drives solutions forward, rather than simply sitting on past ideas. Every product, client and company is different, and in my experience I've never ran a single pipeline the same. This allows a 'rolodex' of modular process pieces that can be implemented, adjusted and revised to build a whole new pipeline, saving resources to be used otherwise.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
